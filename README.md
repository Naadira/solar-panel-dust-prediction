## Features

- **Dust Detection Model:** Trained a computer vision model to identify and quantify dust on solar panels.
  
- **Streamlit Web Application:** Created an [interactive web application](https://solarpanelimageclassifier.streamlit.app/) using Streamlit to visualize and analyze the dust detection results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Streamlit
  
### Data Preprocessing

Image preprocessing is an essential step in preparing the data for model training. In this project, we used the following preprocessing steps:

- Image resizing to 256x256 pixels.
- Batch normalization.
- Batch size of 32.

## The Computer Vision Model

### Model

Utilizing the AlexNet architecture. The model architecture includes:

- AlexNet base model.
- Batch normalization layers.
- Flatten layer.
- Dense layers with dropout for predictions based on the two classes.

### Training

The model was trained for 20 epochs. The achieved accuracy on the validation set is approximately 95%.

### Pre-trained Model

The pre-trained model for chest solar panel image classification is available in the repository as solarpanelimageclassification.h5.
